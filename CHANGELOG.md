### ðŸš€ Phase 2 Complete: Payout Optimization & Explainability

This release completes Phase 2 development, delivering deterministic payout optimization, AI-powered decision explanations, and production-ready infrastructure for transparent vendor payout management.

#### Highlights
- **Deterministic Payout Optimization**: Fixed weights for cost (0.5), speed (0.3), and limits (0.2) scoring
- **AI-Powered Decision Explanations**: Azure OpenAI integration for human-readable payout reasoning
- **CloudEvents Integration**: Complete CloudEvent emission for payout optimization decisions with schema validation
- **Production Infrastructure**: Robust CI/CD workflows with security scanning
- **MCP Integration**: Enhanced Model Context Protocol verbs for explainability features

#### Core Features
- **Payout Optimization Engine**: Advanced scoring and ranking of payment rails (ACH, Wire, RTP, V-Card)
- **Rail Management**: Comprehensive payment rail configuration and limit validation
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent cost-based rail selection with speed and limit considerations
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for payout optimization and decision explanations
- **Event Processing**: Advanced event handling and CloudEvent emission

#### Quality & Infrastructure
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with payout optimization and API validation
- **Security Hardening**: Enhanced security validation and risk assessment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Complete GitHub Actions workflow with security scanning
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API and contract documentation
