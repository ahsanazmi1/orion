Orion is a minimal Python service for the [Open Checkout Network (OCN)](https://github.com/ahsanazmi1/ocn-common). It provides core functionality and serves as a foundation for building more complex services within the OCN ecosystem. Orion follows modern Python development practices with FastAPI, comprehensive testing, and automated CI/CD workflows.

## Quickstart (â‰¤ 60s)

Get up and running with Orion OCN Agent in under a minute:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ahsanazmi1/orion.git
cd orion

# Setup everything (venv, deps, pre-commit hooks)
make setup

# Run tests to verify everything works
make test

# Start the service
make run
```

**That's it!** ðŸŽ‰

The service will be running at `http://localhost:8000`. Test the endpoints:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# MCP getStatus
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"verb": "getStatus", "args": {}}'

# MCP getPayoutOptions
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp/invoke \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"verb": "getPayoutOptions", "args": {}}'
```

### Additional Makefile Targets

```bash
make lint        # Run code quality checks
make fmt         # Format code with black/ruff
make clean       # Remove virtual environment and cache
make help        # Show all available targets
```

## Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer manual setup over the Makefile:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run tests
pytest -q

# Start the service
uvicorn orion.api:app --reload
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## Development

This project uses:
- **FastAPI** for the web framework
- **pytest** for testing
- **ruff** and **black** for code formatting
- **mypy** for type checking
